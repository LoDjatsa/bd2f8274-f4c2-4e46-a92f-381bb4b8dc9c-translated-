    "motivations": "I'm motivated by the chance to contribute to a pioneering governance model at this critical stage in Cardano's evolution. My passion for education, decentralisation, community building, innovation, translation and interpretation has led me to study and follow Cardano's development closely, and I'm excited by the prospect of taking a more active role in its governance. ",
    "objectives": "My conviction is that Cardano can demonstrate how blockchain technology can address real governance challenges in traditional systems, creating models that might inspire change in regions struggling with centralized control. Through inclusive governance, we can build systems that truly represent the needs and aspirations of global communities.\nMy core belief is that blockchain governance must break beyond language barriers. As a francophone, I've experienced how language exclusion limits participation in global systems. Cardano has the opportunity to lead in creating multilingual governance processes that welcome voices from all backgrounds. Diverse perspectives make the ecosystem more resilient and innovative.",
